		%p Kaiwa Deck lets you:
		%p <strong> Save Time! </strong> You can create entire conversation card decks for an entire classroom on your normal computer in mere minutes. Writing cards by hand takes hours -- hours that you could better spend doing what you do best: teaching. Leave the busywork to the computer.
		%p <strong> Save Money! </strong> Don't spend $10-$15 on buying single card decks from traditional publishers -- Kaiwa Deck can make an infinite number of activities! If you plan on using conversation decks three times or more in your teaching career it's much cheaper to use Kaiwa Deck!
		%p <strong> Save Paper! </strong> Students can use their own iPhones and other smartphones, tablets, or computers to use Kaiwa Deck.
		%p <strong>Tailor your activities!</strong> If you buy bingo sets from publishers, you're limited to what they have in stock.  If you make custom bingo cards yourself, you will always be able to match them directly to your lesson plan and students.  Try playing vocabulary bingo with vocabulary from the chapter you just finished reading, for example.
		%p <strong>Keep your students interested in learning!</strong> Children and adults of all ages love playing bingo. We have a variety of ideas on how you can use this to teach, assess, and motivate.
		%p <strong>Teach almost any subject!</strong> If you can type it on your computer, you can put it on a bingo card. Vocabulary lists, letters, numbers, math facts, social studies facts, student names great for first day jitters), famous people -- the choices are endless! See some examples of what we've done with this flexibility.
